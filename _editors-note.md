# Editor's Note {epub:type=other-credits}

All praise belongs to Allāh, Lord of all the worlds. May peace and
blessings be upon our Prophet Muḥammad, upon his family, his companions
and all those who follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment.

This [pdf]{.smallcaps} file is a translation of Ibn Ḥazm's !m[him] book _Kitāb al-Akhlāq wa al-Siyar fī Mudāwat al-Nufūs_.
Its content is from [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/AlIkhlaqWalSiyarMoralsAndBehaviourIbnHazmforBothTeachersAndTheTaught).
It was originally part of the book _In Pursuit of Virtue_ by Shaykh Muḥammad Abū Laylā.
I've edited the source that was used for this document.
Most of the edits are in punctuation.
However, some points didn't flow well in English and were edited.
Some other points were compared with the original Arabic and edited accordingly.
The latter are discussed in the footnotes.
I've also replaced the term “God” with “Allāh” throughout the document.

The following works were referenced:

1. [[source a]]{.smallcaps} _Risālah fī Mudāwāh al-Nufūs wa Tahdhīb al-Akhlāq_ (Egypt: Nile Printers, [ah]{.smallcaps} 1323),
2. [[source b]]{.smallcaps} _Kitāb al-Akhlāq wa al-Siyar_ (Beirut: Dār Ibn Ḥazm, n.d.),
3. [[source c]]{.smallcaps} _Rasāʾil Ibn Ḥazm_ (Beirut: Muʾassasah al-ʿArabiyyah li al-Dirāsāt wa al-Nashr, 2nd Ed. 1987), and
4. [[source d]]{.smallcaps} _In Pursuit of Virtue_ (UK: Ta-Ha Publishers, 1990).
