# Physical Beauty

When I was asked to examine this matter, this is how I responded:

176. Gracefulness consists of delicate features, supple movements, graceful
gestures, a soul in harmony with the form which fate has given it, even where
there is no visible beauty.

177. Allure is beauty of each feature regarded separately. But someone whose
features are beautiful when considered separately can still appear cold and be
without piquantness,[^mean-piquant] charm, seductiveness, or grace.

178. Seductiveness is the aura of the visible parts; it also goes by the name
of elegance and attractiveness.

179. Charm is a certain something which has no other name to explain it. It is
the soul which perceives it, and everyone knows what it is as soon as they see
it. It is like a veil covering the face, a shining light which draws all
hearts to it so that all agree that it is beautiful, even if it is not
accompanied by beautiful features. Anyone who sees it is seduced, charmed,
enslaved, and yet if you looked at each feature separately you would find
nothing special. It might be said that there is a certain unknown something
which you see when you look into the soul. This is the supreme kind of beauty.
However, tastes do differ. Some prefer seductiveness, others prefer
gracefulness. But I have never met anyone who preferred allure as such.

180. We call beauty piquant when there is a combination of some of these
qualities.
