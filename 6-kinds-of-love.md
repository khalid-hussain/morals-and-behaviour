# Different Kinds of Love

155. I have been asked to focus on what there is to say about love, and the
     different kinds of love. All the different kinds of love belong to the same
     family. Love is characterized by longing for the loved one, horror of
     separation, hope of having one's love reciprocated. It has been suggested
     that the sentiment varies according to its object. But the object varies
     only according to the lover's desires, according to whether they are on the
     increase, the decrease, or are vanishing altogether. Thus, love felt for
     Allāh Almighty is perfect love; that which unites beings in the quest for
     the same ideal, the love of a father, a son, parents, a friend, a
     sovereign, a wife, a benefactor, a person in whom one has placed one's
     hopes, a lover, all is generally the same, all is love, but there are
     different species as I have just listed, differing by the amount of love
     inspired by what the loved one is able to give of itself. Thus love can
     take different forms: we have seen men die broken-hearted because of their
     sons exactly as a lover might have his heart broken by his loved one. We
     have heard of a man who burnt with such fear of Allāh, with such love, that
     he died of it. We know that a man can be as jealous of them as a lover is
     of his mistress.

156. The least that the lover can desire of the loved one is to win her esteem,
     her attention, and to approach her---not daring to expect more. This is how
     far those aspire who love each other for Allāh Almighty.

157. The next stage is when desire grows as time is spent together, in
     conversation, and interest is shown by one another. This is the level of
     the love of a man towards his prince, his friend, or his own brother.

158. But the height of what a lover may wish from the loved one is to take her
     in his arms when he desires her. That is why we see a man who is
     passionately fond of his wife trying different positions in making love,
     and different places, so as to feel that he possesses her more completely.
     It is in this category that we should put caresses and kisses. Some of
     these desires may arise in a father towards his child and may drive him to
     [express them] in kisses and caresses.

159. Everything that we have just mentioned is uniquely the function of
     [extreme] desire. When for some reason, the desire for some object is
     suppressed, the soul is driven towards a different object of desire.

160. Thus we find that the man who believes in the possibility of seeing Allāh
     Almighty longs for it, has a great yearning for it and will never be
     satisfied with anything less since it is that which he desires. On the
     other hand, a man who does not believe in it does not aspire to this
     ecstasy and does not wish for it, having no desire for it. He is content to
     bow to divine will and to go to the mosque. He has no other ambition.

161. We have observed that a man who is legally able to marry his close
     relatives is not satisfied with favours which would satisfy someone who is
     not permitted to marry them. His love does not stop at the same point as
     the love of a man who is forbidden by law to love them. Those, such as
     Magians and Jews, who are permitted to marry their own daughters and
     nieces, do not curb their love at the same point as a Muslim does. On the
     contrary, they feel the same love towards their daughters or to their
     nieces as a Muslim does to a woman he will sleep with. One never sees a
     Muslim desiring his close relatives in this way, even if they are more
     beautiful than the sun itself, even if he is the most
     debauched[^mean-debauched] and the most amorous[^mean-amorous] of men. And
     if, very exceptionally, it should happen, it would be only among the
     impious, who do not feel the constraint of the religion, and who allow
     themselves every lustful thought, and who find every gate of desire open to
     them. It cannot be guaranteed that a Muslim might not love his cousin so
     excessively that his love became a passion and overstepped the affection
     which he bore towards his daughter and niece, even if the cousin was not so
     beautiful as they. In fact he might desire favours from his cousin which he
     would never expect from his daughter or his niece. On the other hand, a
     Christian will treat his cousin with equal respect, for he is not permitted
     to desire her. But [unlike a Muslim] he does not have to restrain himself
     with anyone who shared a wet nurse with him, since he may desire her
     without offending the laws of his religion.

162. We now see the truth of what we said earlier: love in all its
     manifestations forms one single generic family, but its species vary
     according to the different objects of its desire.

163. Having said this, human nature is the same everywhere but different customs
     and religious beliefs have created apparent differences.

164. We do not say that desire has an influence only on love. We would say that
     is the cause of all kinds of cares, even those which concern one's fortune
     and social position. Thus it may be observed that a man who sees the death
     of his neighbour, or of his maternal uncle, his friend, his cousin, his
     great-uncle, his nephew, his maternal grandfather or his grandson, having
     no claim on their property, does not fret because it has escaped him,
     however large and considerable their fortunes might be, because he had no
     expectation of them. But as soon as a distant member of his father's family
     dies, or one of his remotest clients, he begins to covet their belongings.
     And with the coveting comes crowding in anxiety, regret, anger, and great
     sorrow if some tiny part of their fortune escapes him.

165. It is the same with one's position in society: a man who belongs to the
     lowest social class does not fret if he is not consulted when someone else
     is given charge of the affairs of the land. He does not fret if someone
     else is promoted or demoted. But as soon as he begins to feel an ambition
     to better himself, it provokes so much worry, anxiety, and anger that it
     could make him lose his soul, his world, and his position in the hereafter
     [lose his soul here and in the hereafter]. Thus covetousness is the cause
     of all humiliation and every kind of anxiety. It is a wicked and despicable
     kind of behaviour.

166. The opposite of covetousness is disinterest. This is a virtuous quality
     which combines courage, generosity, justice, and intelligence. A
     disinterested man is truly intelligent because he understands the vanity of
     covetousness and prefers disinterest. His courage gives birth to a
     greatness of spirit which makes him disinterested. His natural generosity
     stops him fretting about property which is lost to him. His equitable
     nature makes him love reserve and moderation in his desires. Thus
     disinterest is composed of these four qualities, just as covetousness, its
     opposite, is composed of the four opposite faults, that is, cowardice,
     greed, injustice, and ignorance.

     Greed is a kind of covetousness which would like to possess everything; it is
     insatiable and ever increasing in its demands. If there were no such thing as
     covetousness, nobody would ever humiliate himself to anybody else. Abū Bakr bin
     Abī al-Fayyāḍ has told me that “ʿUthmān bin Muḥāmis [d.\ [ah]{.smallcaps}
     356/966 [ce]{.smallcaps}] inscribed upon the door of his house in Ecija [in
     Seville],‘O ʿUthmān, do not covet anything.’”

## Other Species of this Kind

167. A man made unhappy by the presence of a person he detests is like a man
     made unhappy by the absence of the person he loves. There is nothing to
     choose between them.

168. When a lover wishes to forget, he is sure to be able to do so. This wish is
     always granted.

169. If you treat the person you live with with respect, he will treat you with
     respect.

170. The man who is unhappy in love is the one who is racked by a passion for
     one whom he can keep locked away and with whom he may be united without
     incurring the wrath of Allāh or the criticism of his fellow men. All is
     well when the two lovers agree in loving each other. For love to run its
     course freely, it is essential that the two do not feel bored, for that is
     a bad feeling which gives rise to hatred. Perfect love would be if destiny
     forgot the two lovers while they were enjoying each other. But where could
     that happen except in Paradise? Only there can love be sure of shelter, for
     that is the home of everlasting stability. Otherwise, in the world, such
     feelings are not protected from misfortunes, and we go through life without
     ever tasting pleasure to the fullest.

171. When jealousy dies, you may be sure that love has also died.

172. Jealousy is a virtuous feeling which is made of courage and justice; truly,
     a just man hates to infringe the sacred rights of others, and hates to see
     others infringe his own sacred rights. When courage is inborn in a person,
     it gives rise to a grandeur of spirit which abhors injustice.

173. A man whose fortunes I have followed during these times told me once that
     he himself had never known jealousy until he was racked by love. Only then
     did he feel jealous. This man was corrupt by nature, he was a bad
     character, but nevertheless he was perspicacious[^mean-perspicacious] and
     generous.

174. There are five stages in the growth of love: first is to think someone
     pleasant, that is, someone thinks of someone else as being nice or is
     charmed by their character. This is part of making friends. Then there is
     admiration, i.e. the desire to be near the person that one admires. Then
     there is close friendship when you miss the other one terribly when they
     are absent. Then there is amorous[^mean-amorous] affection when you are
     completely obsessed with the loved one. In the special vocabulary of love
     this is called _ʿishq_,“the slavery of love.” Finally, there is passion,
     when one can no longer sleep, eat, or think. This can make you ill to the
     point of delirium[^mean-delirium] or even death. Beyond this, there is
     absolutely no place where love ends.

175. We used to think that passion was found more often among lively and
     emotional women. But our experience has shown that this is not the case.
     Passion is found most often among calm women, as long as their calmness is
     not the placidity[^mean-placidity] of stupidity.
