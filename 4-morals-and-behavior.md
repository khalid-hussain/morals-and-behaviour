# Morals and Behaviour

56. Take care to have a reputation of being a man of good intention. Beware of
    gaining reputation of being devious or people will avoid you more and more
    and you will finish by being harmed or even lost.

57. Train yourself to think about the things that frighten you. If they come to
    pass, you will not be so worried by them. You will not lose anything by
    growing accustomed to the thought of them, and your pleasure will be greater
    or even doubled if something nice or unexpected happens.

58. When worries multiply, they will all fall to the ground [A way out will be
    found].

59. A deceitful man may occasionally keep his word to a lucky man, and a
    faithful man may occasionally betray an unlucky man. Happy is he who in this
    world is not obliged by fate to put his friends to the test.

60. Do not worry about a man who wishes you ill. If fortune favours you, he is
    lost and your luck will protect you. If fortune does not favour you, then
    anyone can harm you.

61. Blessed is the man who knows his own faults better than others know them.

62. Patience in the face of others' insolence is of three kinds: patience with
    someone who has power over you when you have none over him; patience with
    someone you have power over when he has none over you; finally patience with
    someone when neither of you has power over the other. The first kind is
    humiliating and degrading; it is not a virtue. The advice for someone who is
    afraid of such an intolerable situation would be to abandon everything and
    run away. The second kind is a virtue, it is charitable, it is true
    meekness[^mean-meekness] which characterizes virtuous souls. The third sort
    consists of two kinds. The insolence may arise from a misunderstanding or
    from fear, and the one at fault may realize the ugliness of his act and
    regret it. To be patient with him would be a virtue and an obligation; this
    is true magnanimity.[^mean-magnanimity] But with a person who overestimates
    his own value and is proud and arrogant and feels no regret for his action,
    to tolerate this is humiliating, it encourages the wrongdoer in his
    wrongdoing, because he will act even more violently and it would be stupid
    to respond in the same way. The wisest course of action is to let him know
    that you could fight back but that you are refraining from doing so because
    he is beneath contempt and unworthy of your attention. No more is necessary.
    As for the insolent behaviour of the lower classes, the only remedy is to
    punish it.

63. Anyone who mingles with the crowd is never short of worries to pain him, or
    sins to regret on the day when he will return to Allāh, or anger to give him
    a pain in the liver [heart],[^spleen] or humiliation to make him hang his
    head. Then what shall I say about someone who is intimate with people and
    always in their company? Solitude is where you will find dignity, repose,
    happiness, and security. You should treat company like a fire. Warm yourself
    but do not fall in; ["You may draw near but without going right in"].

[^spleen]: Ibn Ḥazm's text states clearly that he has been told that the spleen
is the seat of both good and bad temper. He may have had this idea from reading
the works of Ibn Qutaybah (d.\ [ah]{.smallcaps} 276/889 [ce]{.smallcaps}), who
reported it from Wahb bin Munabbih, who in turn ascribed it to the Torah. Allāh
created man from the four elements water, earth, fire, and air; wet, dry, hot,
and cold. Allāh then gave him a mind in his head, covetousness in his kidneys,
anger is his liver, determination in his heart, fear and terror in his lungs,
emotions, laughter, and tears in his spleen, his happiness and sadness in his
face, and in the human body he made 360 joints. This is a medical matter which
may be true but it is for doctors to say. See p.\ 62, vol.\ 2 of _ʿUyūn
al-Akhbār_ (Cairo: al-Muʾassasah al-Miṣrīyyah al-ʿAmmāh li al-Taʾlīf, n.d.) by
Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd Allāh bin Muslim bin Qutaybah.

    ʿIyāḍ bin Khalīfah said that, during the battle of Ṣiffīn, he heard ʿAlī
    !p[him] say, “Indeed, the intellect is in the heart, mercy in the liver,
    pity in the spleen, and the soul/self in the lungs.” (Reported by
    al-Bukhārī in _al-Adab al-Mufrad_, ḥadīth no.\ 547. Shaykh al-Albānī
    declared it _ḥasan_. See the recension of _al-Adab al-Mufrad_ by Muḥammad
    Fuʾād ʿAbd al-Bāqī. [Beirut: Dār al-Bashāʾir al-Islāmīyyah, 1989]).

64. If the company of the people had only the two following faults, it would be
    enough to keep us away: the first is letting out vital secrets during a
    friendly meeting, secrets which otherwise would never have been revealed.
    The second is showing off, putting our immortality[^mean-immortality] in
    mortal peril. There is no other escape from these two trials than to
    withdraw into absolute solitude, far from people altogether.

لا تحقرن شيئاً من عمل غد أن تحققه بان تعجله اليوم وان قل فإن من قليل الأعمال يجتمع كثيرها، وربما اعجز أمرها عند ذلك فبطل الكل. 
-->

65. Do not put off to tomorrow what you can do today. If you recognize this
    obligation you will make haste to do today even very small preparations for
    tomorrow, for if a small number of tasks are left to mount up they become a
    great number. In fact they have become too many to do and the whole
    enterprise will be wrecked.

66. Do not despise any of the actions that you hope to see counted in your
    favour on the Day of Resurrection. By doing them now, even in small measure,
    these actions will eventually outweigh the number of your sins which would
    otherwise add up to sufficient reason to throw you into hellfire.

67. With depression, poverty, misfortune, and fear, the pain is only felt by the
    sufferer. People looking at them from the outside have no idea what they are
    like. On the other hand, with false judgment, shame, and sin, only the
    onlooker sees how horrible they are! The person who is sunk deep in them
    does not perceive this.

68. Security, health, and wealth are only appreciated by a person who does not
    have them. Anyone who has them does not appreciate them. On the other hand,
    a sound judgment and virtue and working towards eternity, their value is
    known only to those who share in them. Anyone who has no share in them has
    no knowledge of what they are like.

<!-- 69. The first person to break with a deceiver is the one whom the deceiver had
deceived. The first person to detest a false witness is the person whom the
false witness supported. The first person to despise an adulterous woman is
the man who caused her to commit adultery. -->

<!-- Point 69: Thanks to Zahid -->

69. The first person to break away from a deceiver is the one whom the deceiver
    had deceived. The first person to detest a false witness is the person whom
    the false witness had wrongly supported with his testimony. The first person
    to despise an adulterous woman is the man who caused her to commit adultery.

70. As far as we know, nothing can be degraded and then resume its natural state
    without great trouble and difficulty. What can we say about the man whose
    head is poisoned by intoxication every night? Indeed, a mind which drives
    its master towards its own deprivation every night must be a mind condemned.

<!-- Arabic Source C
الطريق تبرم، والزوايا تكرم، وكثرة المال ترغب وقلته تقنع.
 -->

71. The highway [or a long journey] is fatiguing, a quiet retreat is
    restorative. Too much wealth makes for greed. A small fortune makes for
    contentment.

<!-- Arabic Source C
قد ينحس العاقل بتدبيره ولا يجوز أن يسعد الأحمق بتدبيره.
 -->

72. The plans of an intelligent man may go wrong. The plans of a stupid man
    never go right.

73. Nothing is more harmful to a governor than to be surrounded by a great
    number of unemployed people. A prudent ruler knows how to keep them busy
    without being unfair to them, otherwise they will overwhelm him with petty
    matters.

    <!-- Arabic Source C
    مقرب أعدائه قاتل نفسه.
     -->

    Anyone who invites his enemies to come closer to him is suicidal.[^This
    appears as a separate point in Source C.]

74. Anyone who sees an important person too often regards him as less eminent
    and less important.

75. Parading, putting on, for example, a severe and discontented air, this is
    the veil with which ignorant people who have risen in the world try to cover
    their ignorance.

76. A wise man should not delude himself about friendship which started when he
    was in power, because everyone was his friend then.

77. The best person to help you in your affairs is someone with equal interest
    in their success. Do not get anyone to help you who would be just as well
    off elsewhere.

78. Do not respond to talk which is brought by someone on the part of a third
    person, unless you are sure that the latter did say it, because the one who
    brought lies to you will go away carrying the truth [the unpleasant truth
    which you will have told him and which he will hawk around].

79. Put your trust in a pious man, even if the religion that he practises is a
    different one from your own. Do not put your trust in anyone who scorns
    sacred things, even if he claims to belong to your own religion. As for a
    man who defies the commandments of the Almighty, do not ever trust him with
    anything you care greatly about.

وجدت المشاركين بأرواحهم أكثر من المشاركين بأموالهم، هذا شيء طال اختباري اياه، ولم أجد قط على طول التجربة سواه، فأعيتني معرفة العلة في ذلك حتى قدرت أنها طبيعة في البشر.
-->

80. I have noticed that people are more generous with their opinions than with
    their pennies. In my long study of this matter, this has never been
    disproved despite countless observations. Since I cannot understand the
    cause of this, I suppose it must be innate in human nature.

81. It is the height of injustice to deny a habitual wrongdoer the opportunity
    of doing an occasional good deed.

<!-- Arabic Source C
من استراح من عدو واحد حدث له أعداء كثيرة
-->

82. When you get rid of one enemy you see a great many others advancing.

83. I have never seen anything more lifelike than the shadow-theatre with its
    little actors mounted on wooden handles that are turned rapidly so that some
    disappear and others appear.[^puppet]

[^puppet]: This is an important historical reference to shadow-theatres in
al-Andalus in the time of Ibn Ḥazm. c.f. Ibn Ḥazm, _al-Fiṣal_, vol.\ 1, p.\ 110
and vol.\ 5, p.\ 6.

84. For a long time I have been thinking about death. I had certain dear
    friends, as closely bound to me by the bonds of sincere affection as the
    soul is bound to the body. After they died, some of them appeared to me in
    dreams. Others did not. While one of the latter was alive, we had each
    promised to visit the other in a dream after we had died, if at all
    possible. But I have not seen him at all since he preceded me into the other
    world. I do not know whether he has forgotten or been engaged.

[غفلة النفس ونسيانها ما كانت فيه في دار الابتداء قبل حلولها في الجسد كغفلة من وقع في طين غمر عن كل ما عهد وعرف قبل ذلك. ثم أطلت الفكر أيضاً في ذلك فلاح لي شعب زائد من البيان. وهو أني رأيت النائم اذ همت نفسه بالتخلي من جسده وقوي حسها حتى تشاهد الغيوب قد نسيت ما كان فيه قبيل نومها نسياناً تاماً البتة على قرب عهدها به، وحدثت لها أحوال أخر، وهي في كل ذلك ذاكرة حساسة متلذذة آلمة، ولذة النوم محسوسة في حاله، لان النائم يلتذ ويحتلم ويخاف ويحزن في حال نومه].
 -->

85. The oblivion of the soul who forgets the state it was in in the world of
    temptation [its first abode] while waiting for the resurrection of the body
    [to enter the body] is like the oblivion of someone who has fallen into mud
    and has sunk [all his promises] together with everything which he knew
    before and which was familiar to him. I have also reflected for a long time
    about this matter, and it seems to be that there is another possible
    explanation in addition to the one just mentioned. I have studied a sleeping
    person at the moment when his soul leaves his body, and his senses sharpen
    to the point of being able to see the unseen; the soul forgets completely,
    absolutely, the state which it was in just a moment before falling asleep,
    although it was so recent.

    The soul knows other states in which it is endowed with memory and
    feelings, it can be pleased, it can be hurt. The joys of sleep are felt
    even during the sleep, for the sleeper feels happy, he dreams, he is
    afraid, he is sad, even in his sleep.

86. The soul is not happy except in the company of a soul. The body is heavy and
    wearying. This is proved by the haste with which one buries the body of a
    loved one when the soul has departed from it, and by the sorrow caused by
    the disappearance of the soul although the corpse is still there.

87. I have never seen Shayṭān use a worser trick, or an uglier or a more foolish
    one, than when he puts two phrases onto the tongues of those who follow him.
    The first is when someone excuses his own evil deed by alleging that someone
    has done the same to him. The second is when someone makes light of doing
    evil today because he did evil yesterday, or he does wrong in one sense
    because he has already done it in another. These two phrases excuse and
    facilitate evil-doing; they bring it into the arena of what is acceptable,
    tolerable, and not to be criticized.

<!-- Arabic Source C
استعمل سوء الظن حيث تقدر على توفيته حقه في التحفظ والتاهب، واستعمل حسن الظن حيث لا طاقة بك على التحفظ فتربح راحة النفس
-->

88. Be mistrustful if you are able to be sufficiently careful and cautious, but
    if you cannot check on them, you will have to trust people. This will bring
    you peace of mind.

89. The definition of generosity, the supreme objective of generosity, is to
    give away the entire surplus of your possessions in charitable works. The
    best charitable work is to bring relief to a neighbour in need, a poor
    relative, and a man who has lost his own possessions and is close to ruin.
    Anyone who holds on to this superfluous money without spending it in one of
    these ways is an example of miserliness. And he should be praised and
    criticized in proportion to whether he is more or less generous in this way.
    Anything given to causes which are not these charitable ones is squandered,
    and the action is blameworthy. It is virtuous to give to someone in greater
    need part of what you need to keep alive; this is a nobler act of self
    sacrifice than plain generosity is. To keep what you need is neither
    praiseworthy nor blameworthy but simply fair. To carry out one's obligations
    is a duty;^[This sentence is the start of a separate point in Source C] to
    give away surplus food is generosity. To forget yourself and to give away
    food as long as you will not starve yourself is a virtue. To hinder anyone
    against performing his duty is against the Law. To refuse to give away the
    leftovers of our food is greedy and extremely miserly. To refuse to deprive
    yourself in order to give away part of your food which you need is
    excusable. To deprive yourself of food, and to deprive your family to any
    extent, is ignoble, vile, and criminal. To be generous with property which
    you have acquired by unfair means is to aggravate the evil already
    committed, and it should be rewarded with criticism, not praise, since you
    are in fact giving away someone else's property, not your own. To give
    people their rightful part of your possessions is not generosity; it is a
    duty.

90. The definition of courage is to fight to the death in defense of religion,
    in defense of womanhood, of ill treated neighbours, of the oppressed who
    seek protection, or in defense of a lost fortune, honour which has been
    attacked, and other rights, against all adversaries, whether they be few or
    many. To do less than this would be cowardliness and weakness. To use up
    one's courage in fighting for the vanities of the world would be stupid
    recklessness. But it is even more stupid to devote your courage to fighting
    against right and duty, either in your own interest or for others. And even
    more stupid than all these, there are men whom I have seen who do not know
    to what cause to devote themselves; sometimes they fight Zayd on ʿAmr's
    account, and sometimes they fight ʿAmr on Zayd's account, sometimes both in
    the same day, exposing themselves needlessly to danger, hurtling towards
    hellfire, or running towards dishonour. About such people the Messenger of
    Allāh !pbuh has warned: “There will come a time for men, when the one who
    kills will not know why he has killed, and his victim will not know why he
    was killed.”

91. The definition of continence is to turn away one's glance and all of one's
    organs of sense from forbidden objects. Everything other than this is
    debauchery. Anyone who goes further, and forbids himself what the Almighty
    has made lawful, is weak and powerless.

92. The definition of justice is to give spontaneously what is due and to know
    how to take what is your right. The definition of injustice is to take one's
    due and not give others their due. The definition of nobility of soul is to
    give spontaneously and with a good heart what is due to others, and to allow
    them their rights willingly; this is also virtue. All generosity is noble
    and virtuous, but not every noble act and every virtue is generous. Virtue
    is a more general term; generosity is more specific. Magnanimity is a virtue
    without being generosity. Virtue is a general prescription to which one adds
    a specific action.

<!-- إهمال ساعة يفسد رياضة سنة. -->

93. One hour of neglect can undo a year of pious effort.

94. In the course of affairs, a mistake made by an individual is better than a
    just policy followed by the whole assembly of Muslims if they are not
    grouped under the leadership of one man. This is because the individual's
    mistake can be put right, but the correct views of the Muslim assembly will
    lead them to ignore something that may have been wrong, and they will be
    lost because of it.

<!-- Original Arabic (Source C: Shamela)
نوار الفتنة لا يعقد
-->

95. _Fitnah's_ blossom does not bear fruit.[^blossom]

[^blossom]: The original trans. reads, “In times of civil war, the blossom does not bear fruit.” The original Arabic reads [نوار الفتنة لا يعقد]{lang=ar} (Source C).

    Its meaning was expounded in p.\ 67, vol. 1 of _al-ʿIrāq fi aḥādīth wa āthār al-Fitan_ (Dubai: Maktabah al-Furqān, 2004):

    ::: {lang=ar}
    والمعنى: أنّ للفتنة مظهراً خادعاً في مبدئه، قد يستحسن الناس صورتها، ويعقدون الآمال عليها، ولكن سرعان ما تموت وتتلاشى، مثل الزهرة التي تموت قبل أنْ تتفتح وتعطي ثمرتها.
    :::

96. I myself had faults, and I tried continually to correct them, by discipline,
    by studying the words of the Prophets !pbuh and also the words of the most
    virtuous sages among the ancients who are more advanced in morality and
    self-discipline, until Allāh helped me overcome most of my faults, thanks to
    His guidance and grace.

    It is an act of perfect virtue, of self-discipline, a sign that one controls
    the truth, to confess such faults in order that one day someone may learn from
    them, if Allāh wills.

97. One of my faults was that I tended to an extreme of self-satisfaction when I
    was in the right and an extreme bad temper when I was in the wrong. Ever
    seeking to cure myself of this, I decided that I would never again display
    any irritations in my remarks, my actions, or my discussions. I renounced
    every kind of triumph that was not permitted, and I suffered under the heavy
    burden of this decision. I had enough patience to bear a dreadful affliction
    which nearly made me sick and an invalid. But I was not capable of
    overcoming my passion to always be in the right. It almost seemed that I did
    not really think this a fault, that I did not really think I should give up
    this attitude.

98. Another fault I had was an ungovernable propensity for sarcasm. What I
    decided to do about this was to refrain from anything that might irritate
    the person I was talking to. But I did allow myself to crack jokes, feeling
    that not to do so would have been narrow-minded and almost arrogant.

99. Another fault: extreme pride. My mind wrangled with my soul, knowing my
    defects, and argued so long and so successfully that my pride vanished
    completely, leaving no trace, thanks be to Allāh. Moreover, I set myself to
    despise myself absolutely and to be a model of humility.

100. Another of my defects was that I suffered from trembling caused by my
     youthfulness and the weakness of my limbs. I forced myself to make it stop,
     and it disappeared.

101. Another fault: a love of great fame and glory. To deal with this defect, I
     decided to renounce everything which was forbidden by religion, Allāh
     helping with the rest, because if the soul remains under the control of
     reason even its irritability can become a virtue and be regarded as a
     praiseworthy disposition.

102. I used to feel extreme repugnance for the company of women on any occasion,
     and this made me difficult to get on with. I seem to have been struggling
     forever against this immoderate feeling, which I know to be bad from the
     problems it has caused me. Allāh help me.

103. I had two faults which the Almighty has kept private and helped me to fight
     and overcome by His goodness. One has completely disappeared, all praise to
     Him for this. In this case, good luck seems to have been on my side: as
     soon as this fault rears its head I hasten to stifle it. But the other
     fault has tormented me for a long time. When its waves came sweeping over
     me, my veins would throb and this fault would be on the point of
     reappearing; but Allāh has allowed me to hold back by one of the
     manifestations of His goodness and it has now disappeared.

104. I used to persist in bearing extreme grudges; I have been enabled to
     conceal and hide this with the help of the Almighty and to avoid the
     manifestation of all its effects. But I have never been able to stamp it
     out completely, nor have I ever found it possible to make friends with
     anyone who has acted in a truly hostile way towards me.

<!-- Arabic Source C
وأما سوء الظن فيعده قوم عيباً على الاطلاق وليس كذلك إلا اذا أدى صاحبه إلى ما لا
يحل في الديانة أو ما يقبح في المعاملة والا فهو حزم، والحزم فضيلة.
-->

105. Mistrust itself is regarded by some as an absolute fault. This is not so,
     unless it leads the person who feels it to commit deeds not allowed by
     religion, or to adopt behaviour which is unsocial. In other cases mistrust
     can be steadfastness, and steadfastness is a virtue.

106. As for the reproach made to me by ignorant adversaries who say that I put
     no value on anyone who disagrees with me when I believe that I am in the
     right, and that I would never act in concert with the ones I contradict
     even if they amounted to the entire human population on the face of the
     earth, and that I place no value on conforming with the people of my
     country in many of the customs or costume which they have adopted for no
     particular reason---this independence is a quality which I regard as one of
     my most important virtues. There is nothing equal to it, and, upon my life,
     if I did not possess it (Allāh forbid), it would be this that I most longed
     for, and hoped for, and prayed for to Allāh Almighty. In fact, my advice to
     all who may hear my words is to behave in the same way. There is no benefit
     to be had from copying other people if their actions are vain and
     pointless. By doing so one annoys the Almighty, and disappoints one's mind
     [deludes oneself], causes suffering to one's soul and body, and takes upon
     one's shoulders an unnecessary yoke.

107. A man who knows nothing of the truth has reproached me for not caring about
     wrongs done to me, or even wrongs done to my friends, so that I do not even
     get annoyed if they are wronged in my presence.

108. My reply would be that anyone who has described me like that was speaking
     too hastily and needs to be more precise. When one speaks hastily one slips
     into using language that makes the bad not so bad and the good not so good.
     For example, “So-and-so is sleeping with his sister,” would be an
     abominable thing to say and would horrify everyone who heard it, but if you
     explained that it is a matter of “his sister in Islām,” it would be clear
     that it was hasty speaking that created the indecent and ugly aspect of the
     matter.

<!-- 109. For myself, if I pretended not to feel hurt when I am attacked by
someone, I should not be telling the truth, for it is natural to feel hurt in
such a case, it is only human. But I have forced myself to show neither anger
nor bad temper nor fury. I manage to hold back an angry answer by preparing
myself in advance, then I do so, thanks to the strength and power of Almighty
Allāh. But if I have no time to prepare myself, I restrict myself to
retaliating with cutting phrases, but not insults, and I attempt to say only
what is true, and to express myself without anger or cruelty. I detest doing
even this, except when it is absolutely necessary. For example when I wish to
stop the spread of a false rumour-for most people love to pass on, to anyone
who will listen, hateful tidbits of gossip (which they attribute to a third
person)-and nothing will stop them so effectively as this course of action.
It stops them touting around calumnies which they attribute to others, and
which serve no purpose except to corrupt consciences and to spread slander
only. -->

    attribute to others, and which serve no purpose except to corrupt consciences
    and to spread slander.

110. Furthermore, as for the man who is wronging me, there are two possibilities
     and two only. Either he is lying or telling the truth. If he is lying, then
     Allāh will surely make haste to allow me to refute him by his own tongue,
     for this man will go the way of all liars and will draw attention to my
     merit by falsely imputing bad things to me---for sooner or later---this
     will become clear to most of those who listen to him. If he is telling the
     truth, there are three possibilities and only one can be true. Perhaps I
     had been his associate in some business and had confided in him as one does
     with someone one relies on and trusts, and he would then be the most
     despicable sneak: I hardly need say more about such base villainy. Or,
     perhaps he may be criticizing in me something which he regards as a fault
     and which in fact is not. His ignorance is enough to make this oblivious;
     it is he who should be accused, and not the one who he has criticized. Or,
     finally, he may be accusing me of a fault which I really do have. Having
     perceived one of my faults, he has let his tongue wag about it. If he is
     telling the truth, I deserve more blame than he does. In that case, I
     should be angry with myself, not with my critic, who is justified in his
     criticism.

وأما أمر إخواني فإني لست أمسك عن الامتعاض لهم، لكني أمتعض امتعاضاً رقيقاً لا أزيد فيه على أن أندم القائل منهم بحضرتي وأجعله يتذمم ويتعذر ويخجل ويتنصل، وذلك بأن أسلك به طريق ذم من نال من الناس، وان نظر المرء في أمر نفسه والتهمم بإصلاحها أولى به من تتبع عثرات الناس، وبأن أذكر فضل صديقي فأبكته على اقتصاره على ذكر العيب دون ذكر الفضيلة وأن أقول له: "إنه لا يرضى فيك فهو أولى بالكرم منك، فلا ترض لنفسك بهذا،" أو نحو هذا من القول. وأما أن أهارش القائل فأحميه وأهيج طباعه وأستثير غضبه فينبعث منه في صديقي أضعاف ما أكره، فأنا الجاني حينئذ على صديقي والمعرض له بقبيح السب وتكراره فيه وإسماعه من لم يسمعه والإغراء به، وربما كنت أيضاً في ذلك جانياً على نفسي ما لا ينبغي لصديقي أن يرضاه لي من إسماعي الجفاء والمكروه، وأنا لا أريد من صديقي أن يذب عني بأكثر من الوجه الذي حددت، فان تعدى ذلك إلى أن يساب النائل مني حتى يولد بذلك أن يتضاعف النيل وان يتعدى أيضاً اليه بقبيح المواجهة، وربما إلى أبوي وأبويه على قدر سفه النائل ومنزلته من البذاءة وربما كانت منازعة بالأيدي، فأنا مستنقص لفعله في ذلك زار عليه متظلم منه غير شاكر له، لكني ألومه على ذلك أشد اللوم، وبالله تعالى التوفيق.

111. As for my friends, I have not forbidden myself to defend them. But I do it
     gently, contenting myself with persuading the person who has slandered them
     in my presence to repent, urging him to reproach himself, to apologize, to
     feel ashamed, and to take back what he said. I achieve this by following
     the method which consists of blaming the slanderers and telling them that
     it would be better to mind their own business and put their own houses in
     order rather than track down the faults of others. I go on to recall the
     merits of my friend, reproaching the critic for limiting himself to
     recalling his faults without mentioning his virtues, and saying to him, “He
     would never speak like that about you. He has a more generous spirit than
     you, and that is what you would not accept,” or something similar. As for
     attacking the speaker, annoying him, irritating him, making him angry, in
     this way pushing him to increase the insults to my friend which I so
     dislike, this would make me guilty towards my friend because it would
     expose him to coarse and repeated insults which would be spread to the ears
     of those who had not heard them before and would give rise to further
     slander. Perhaps this would make me just as guilty towards myself, which
     would not suit my friend, because I should suffer insult and injury. For
     myself, I would not want my friend to defend me beyond the limits I have
     outlined. If he goes further to attack him, or even my father, my mother,
     and his own parents, depending on how insolent and impudent the one who
     started it is. They might even come to blows, I should scorn him, because
     he had brought this upon me; I certainly would not be grateful to him. On
     the contrary I should be extremely cross with him. Allāh help us!

112. A man of prejudice who never stops to think has accused me of squandering
     my fortune. This is more hasty talk, which I would explain as follows: I
     only squander the portion which it would be against my religion to keep or
     would cast aspersion on my honour or would fatigue me. I consider that what
     I avoid of these three evils, however small, far outweighs the amount of
     fortune lost, even if it amounted to everything that the sun shines on.

113. The best gift that Allāh can give His servant is to endow him with justice
     and a love of justice, with truth and a love of truth [equity] above all
     else. To stamp out my evil tendencies, to do everything which is good
     according to religion and to the world, I have done only what I could.
     There is no strength and power except in Allāh Almighty. On the other hand,
     a man who has a natural tendency towards injustice and who finds it easy to
     act unjustly, a man who has tendency to transgress and enjoys doing it, let
     him despair of ever improving or of amending his nature. Let him realize
     that he will not succeed, either in religion or in good conduct.

114. As for vanity, envy, falsehood, and treachery, I have absolutely no
     experience of them from my nature. It seems that I have no merit for
     avoiding them since all my being spurns them. Thanks for this be rendered
     to Allāh, Lord of the Worlds.

115. One of the defects of the love of renown is that it cancels out the value
     of good deeds, if the man performing them likes them to be spoken of. This
     makes him almost impious because he is working for something other than
     Allāh. This defect removes all the value from virtues because the man
     affected by it is hardly trying at all to do good for the sake of good, but
     for love of renown.

116. There is no worse blame than that of a man who praises a quality in you
     that you do not have, thereby drawing closer to its absence.

117. There is no better praise than that of a man who reproaches you for a fault
     that you do not have, thereby drawing attention to your merit, and he gives
     you your revenge on him by exposing himself to rebuttal and the reproach of
     having slandered you.

118. If one knew one's imperfections, one would be perfect. Since no creature is
     exempt from faults, happy the man whose defects are few and unimportant.

119. The thing that happens most often is something unexpected. Steadfastness
     consists of preparing yourself for as much as can be foreseen. Glory be to
     the One who has so arranged it in order to show mankind man's powerlessness
     and his need for his Creator, the Almighty.
