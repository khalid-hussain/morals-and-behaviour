Ibn Ḥazm dedicated his book to the benefit of all mankind.

Here I follow his example in dedicating this book to all my fellow men,
particularly to the very rich, who are in danger of forgetting life's true
values, and to the very poor, who may not realise that they can be rich in the
things that matter. Money is not everything, there are greater treasures
available for all.

The world is for everybody, but heaven is only for the pure in heart, the
virtuous, and most pious.

--- Shaykh Muḥammad Abū Laylā, !PDForEPUB[\bgroup\addfontfeatures{Style=Swash}\textit{In Pursuit of Virtue}\egroup][_In Pursuit of Virtue_].
