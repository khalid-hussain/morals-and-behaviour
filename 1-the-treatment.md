# Treatment of the Souls

3. The pleasure which a prudent man has from his own good sense, a scholar from
   his knowledge, a wise man from his wisdom, the pleasure of anyone who works
   hard in ways pleasing to Almighty Allāh, is greater than the pleasure which
   the gourmet[^mean-gourmet] has from his food, a drinking man from his
   tipple,[^mean-tipple] a lover from the act of love, a conqueror from his
   conquest, a reveller from his amusements [the player from his game] or a
   commander from giving orders. The proof of this is that the wise man, the
   prudent man, the scholar, the practising Muslim, and all those that we have
   mentioned are capable of enjoying these pleasures as much as the man who
   indulges in them. They have the same feelings and desires as those who hasten
   to satisfy them. But they have deliberately refrained and turned away from
   them, preferring to seek after moral excellence. None can judge these two
   [kinds of pleasure] except someone who has known both; not someone who has
   known one and not the other.

4. [As things happen one after the other] If you look deeply into worldly
   matters you will become melancholy[^mean-melancholy] and will end by
   reflecting upon the ephemeral nature of everything here below, and the fact
   that truth lies only in striving for the hereafter, since every ambition to
   which you might cling will end in tears: either the goal is snatched from
   you, or you have to give the attempt up before you reach it. One of these two
   endings is inevitable except in the search for Allāh Almighty and Powerful.
   Then the result is always joy, both immediate and eternal. The immediate joy
   is because you stop worrying about the things which usually worry people;
   this leads to an increase in the respect paid to you by friends and enemies
   alike. The eternal joy is that of Paradise.

5. I have tried to find one goal which everyone would agree to be excellent and
   worthy of being striven after. I have found one only: to be free from
   anxiety. When I reflected upon it, I realized that not only do all agree in
   valuing it and desiring it, but I also perceived that, despite their many
   different passions and aspirations and preoccupations and desires, they never
   make the slightest gesture unless it is designed to drive anxiety far away.
   One man loses his way, another comes close to going wrong, finally another is
   successful---but he is a rare man, and success is rare, [O, All-knowing
   Allāh]. Dispelling anxiety is a goal upon which all nations agree from the
   time when the Almighty created the world until the day when this world will
   pass away and be followed by the Day of Judgment---and their actions are
   directed to this goal alone. In the case of every other objective there will
   always be some people who do not desire it.

    For example, some people are not religious and do not take eternity into
    account. There are some who by nature and inclination prefer obscurity to
    fame [the obscurity of satisfied passion]. There are some who have no
    interest in amassing a fortune, preferring abstinence to ownership; this was
    the case with many of the Prophets !s[them] and those who followed their
    example, ascetics, and philosophers. There are some who by nature dislike
    sensual pleasures and scorn those who seek after them, such as those men we
    have just mentioned, and who prefer to lose a fortune rather than gain one.
    Some prefer ignorance to knowledge, in fact most of the people that you see
    in the street are like this. These are the objectives of people who have no
    other aim in life. Nobody in the whole world, from the time of its creation
    until its end, would deliberately choose anxiety, and would not desire to
    drive it far away.

6. When I had arrived at this great piece of wisdom, when I had discovered this
   amazing secret, when Allāh Almighty had opened the eyes of my mind [spirit]
   to see this great pleasure, I began to search for the way which would truly
   enable me to dispel anxiety, that precious goal desired by every kind of
   person, whether ignorant or scholarly, good or evil. I found it in one place
   alone, in the action of turning towards Allāh, the Almighty and Powerful, in
   pious works performed with an eye to eternity.

7. Thus the only reason that someone chases after riches is to dispel the
   anguish of poverty. The only reason that someone seeks fame is to dispel the
   anxiety of seeing someone else outdo him. The only reason that someone chases
   after pleasures is to dispel the anxiety of missing them. The only reason
   someone chases after knowledge is to dispel the anxiety of being ignorant
   about something. People enjoy listening to other peoples' conversations and
   gossip only because it dispels the anxiety of being alone and isolated.
   People eat, drink, make love, wear clothes, play games, build a shelter,
   mount a horse, and go for walks, only in order to avoid the reverse of all
   these actions and every other kind of anxiety.

8. In all the actions listed here, anyone who pauses to reflect will see that
   anxieties inevitably occur, such as problems which arise in the course of the
   action, the impossibility of performing the impossible, the fleeting nature
   of any achievements, and the inability to enjoy something because of some
   difficulty. There are also bad consequences which arise from every success:
   fear of one's rival, attacks by the jealous, theft by the covetous, loss to
   an enemy, not to mention criticism, sin, and other such things. On the other
   hand, I have found that actions performed with an eye on eternity are free
   from  _every kind_ of fault, free from _every stain_, and a true means of
   dispelling anxiety. I have found that the man who is striving for eternity
   may be sorely tested by bad fortune on his way but does not worry; on the
   contrary, he is glad, because the trial to which he is subjected gives rise
   to hope, which aids him in his endeavour and sets him more firmly on the path
   towards his true desire. I have found that when he finds his way blocked by
   an obstacle, he does not worry, because it is not his fault, and he did not
   choose the actions that he will have to answer for. I have seen such a man be
   glad, when others have wished evil upon him, and be glad when he has
   undergone some trial, and be glad, always [living] in a permanent state of
   joy while others are permanently the opposite. You should therefore
   understand that there is only one objective to strive for, it is to dispel
   anxiety; and only one path leads to this, and that is the service of the Most
   High, Allāh. Everything else is misguided and absurd.

9. Do not use your energy except for a cause more noble than yourself. Such a
   cause cannot be found except in Almighty Allāh Himself: to preach the truth,
   to defend womanhood, to repel humiliation which your Creator has not imposed
   upon you, and to help the oppressed. Anyone who uses his energy for the sake
   of the vanities of the world is like someone who exchanges gemstones for
   gravel.

10. There is no nobility in anyone who lacks faith.

11. The wise man knows that the only fitting price for his soul is a place in
    Paradise.

12. Shayṭān sets his traps under the cover of finding fault with hypocrisy. It
    can happen that someone refrains from doing a good deed for fear of being
    thought a hypocrite. [If Shayṭān whispers such an idea in your ear, take no
    notice; that will frustrate him.]
