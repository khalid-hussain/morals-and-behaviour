<!-- This chapter has footnotes (Makki's Edition) -->

181. Fickleness, which is a fault, consists of switching from one way of life
     which is forced and senseless, to another way of life which is equally
     forced and senseless; from one absurd state to an equally absurd state for
     no good reason.

182. But a man who will adopt habits which suit his capabilities and his needs,
     and who will reject everything that is of no use to him [will be drawing
     on] one of the best sources of good sense and wisdom.

183. The Prophet !pbuh---the model of all goodness, whose character was praised
     by Allāh, in whom Allāh gathered together the most diverse and perfect
     virtues, and whom He kept from sin---was in the habit of visiting the sick,
     accompanied by his friends. They went to the boundaries of Madīnah on foot,
     wearing neither boots nor sandals, hat nor turban. He wore clothes woven
     from the hair of wild beasts when he had them, or he might equally likely
     be wearing embroidered cloth if he had it, never wearing anything
     unnecessary and never forgetting anything necessary, content with what he
     had and doing without whatever he did not have. Sometimes he would ride a
     fine mule or he would ride a horse bareback or a camel or a donkey, with a
     friend riding behind him. Sometimes he ate dates without bread, sometimes
     dry bread, sometimes he ate roast lamb, fresh melon, or _ḥalwā_, taking as
     much as needed and sharing out the surplus, or leaving what he did not need
     and not forcing himself to take more than he needed. He was never angry
     when he found himself alone fighting for a cause, and he let nothing
     prevent him from anger when it was a question of Allāh, the Almighty.

184. The perseverance which consists of keeping one's word and the perseverance
     which is nothing but obstinacy[^mean-obstinacy] are so alike that they can
     only be told apart by someone who knows what different characters are like.
     The difference between the two kinds of perseverance is that obstinacy
     clings to error. Its actions are the actions of someone who persists in
     doing what he has decided upon when he knows that he is wrong, or when he
     does not know for sure whether he is right or wrong. Such obstinacy is
     wrong. The opposite of obstinacy is fairness. As for the kind of
     perseverance which consists of keeping one's word, its actions are the
     actions of someone who is right, or who believes himself to be right, not
     having seen any reason not to believe this. This quality is worthy of
     praise, and its opposite is inconstancy.[^mean-inconstancy] Only the first
     of the two kinds of perseverance [obstinacy] is wrong, because it makes you
     lose the habit of thinking about a matter once it has been decided, and you
     stop wondering whether the decision is right or wrong.

185. Good sense is defined as the practise of obedience to Allāh and the
     practice of piety and virtues. This definition implies avoidance of
     rebellion and vices. Allāh has stated this clearly more than once in His
     book (the Quran), emphasizing that anyone who disobeys Him is acting
     unreasonably. Speaking of certain people, the Almighty has said, “They will
     say: if we had listened, if we had understood, we would not be among the
     damned,” (Quran 67:10) and He has confirmed their words as true by saying,
     “They have recognized their own sins, so misfortune be to the damned.”
     (Quran 67:11)

186. Stupidity is defined as the practice of disobedience to Allāh and the
     practice of vices.

187. As for going wild, throwing stones at people, not knowing what one is
     saying, that is lunacy and excess of bile.

188. Stupidity is opposite of good sense, as we have shown above; and there is
     no middle point between good sense and stupidity unless it is
     ineptitude.[^mean-ineptitude]

189. The definition of ineptitude is to work and speak in a way that neither
     serves religion nor the world nor a healthy morality. This is neither
     disobedience to Allāh nor obedience, it does not bring anybody else to such
     acts, it is neither a virtue nor a harmful vice. It consists only of
     drivelling[^mean-drivelling] and rambling about doing pointless things.
     According to whether these actions are frequent or rare, the person should
     be treated as more or less inept. Moreover he may be inept in one matter,
     sensible in another, stupid in a third.

190. The opposite of madness is the ability to discern and the ability to make
     free use of sciences and technical knowledge. It is what the ancients
     called the “faculty of reasoning.” There is no middle point between these
     two extremes.

191. As for the art of conducting one's affairs and flattering people by means
     that might win their good will and save a situation, such as false dealing,
     perversion or any other bad practices, and as for the tricks which allow
     one to amass a fortune or to increase one's reputation or to achieve glory
     by means of a crime or every kind of base behaviour, these are not the
     works of good sense. Indeed, even those people who avowed that they had
     lost their senses and whose words Allāh confirmed as true when He said that
     they had lost their senses, knew very well how to conduct their worldly
     affairs, build up their fortunes, flatter their rulers, and protect their
     own standing. This characteristic is called astuteness, and the opposite of
     it is intelligence and honesty.

192. However, if in order to achieve these same ends, someone acted with reserve
     and dignity, this would be firmness. Its opposite is weakness or wasting.

193. To be serious, to know how to put each word in the right place, to preserve
     moderation in the way that you conduct your life, to show courtesy towards
     anyone who comes to you, that is called steadiness and is the opposite of
     ineptitude.

194. The virtue of keeping one's word is made up of fairness, generosity, and
     courage. Because a trustworthy man thinks it is unfair to deceive anyone
     who has put his trust in him or anyone who has done him a good deed, he
     acts with fairness. Because he wishes to help to repair the injustices of
     fate as quickly as possible, he acts with generosity. Because he has
     decided to bear without flinching all the likely consequences of his
     fidelity,[^mean-fidelity] he is courageous.

195. Virtues have four roots which form all of virtue. They are: fairness or
     justice, intelligence, courage, and generosity.

196. Vices have four roots which are the basis of all faults and which are the
     opposite of the constituents of the virtues. They are: unfairness,
     ignorance, cowardice, and greed.

<!-- TODO 197: POEM -->

197. Honesty and temperance[^mean-temperance] are two kinds of fairness and generosity.

    Here are some lines of my poetry dealing with morals. Abū Muḥammad Alī bin Aḥmad says:

    | The spirit is the foundation
    |        morals build the fortress upon it.
    | If the spirit does not adorn itself with
    |        knowledge, it will surely find itself in distress.
    | An ignorant person is surely blind
    |        and does not see where he is going.
    | If knowledge is not paired with justice,
    |        it is deceitful.
    | If justice is not paired with generosity,
    |        it is oppressive.
    | Generosity depends on courage.
    |        Cowardice is deceitful.
    | Keep yourself in check if you are jealous.
    |        A jealous person has never yet committed adultery.
    | All these virtues are sublimated in piety.
    |        Truth spreads light when it is spoken.
    | It is from the roots of Good that springs vows
    |         [that bring us nearer to Allāh].

    And here some other lines of poetry in my style: 

    | The reins which control all the virtues are
    |        Justice, intelligence, generosity, and strength.
    | The other virtues are composed of these four.
    |        Anyone who possesses them is at the head of his people.
    | Likewise it is in the head that one finds
    |        The qualities of good sense that enable one to resolve all difficulties.

198. Disinterest as a human quality is a virtue which is made up of courage and
     generosity. The same is true of patience.

199. Magnanimity[^mean-magnanimity] is one kind of courage. It does not have an opposite.

200. Moderation is a virtue which is made up of generosity and fairness.

201. Ruthlessness arises from covetousness, and covetousness arises from envy.
     Envy arises from desire, and desire arises from injustice, greed, and
     ignorance.

202. Ruthlessness gives rise to great vices, such as servility,[^mean-servility]
     theft, anger, adultery, murder, passions, and fear of poverty.

203. To beg for something that belongs to someone else stems from a tendency
     which is midway between ruthlessness and covetousness.

204. If we make a distinction between ruthlessness and covetousness, it is only
     because ruthlessness reveals the covetousness that is hidden in the soul.

205. The art of dealing with people is a quality composed of magnanimity and
     patience.

206. Truthfulness is composed of justice and courage.

207. Anyone who comes to you with lies will go away with truths; that is to say,
     anyone who repeats to you lies which he attributes to a third person will
     make you beside yourself[^beside-yourself] with rage; you will respond to
     him, and your response is the truth that he will carry away. Therefore be
     careful not to behave like this, and only answer when you are certain about
     the provenance[^mean-provenance] of the lies.

[^beside-yourself]: _beside yourself_: In a state of extreme excitement or
agitation. _They were beside themselves with glee._

208. There is nothing worse than falsehood. For how do you not regard a vice
     which has as one of its varieties disbelief or impiety itself? For all
     disbelief is falsehood. Falsehood is the genus and disbelief is one of its
     species. Falsehood arises from wickedness, cowardice, and ignorance. Truly,
     cowardice debases the soul. A liar has a vile soul which is far away from
     achieving greatness worthy of praise.

209. If we categorize people by the way of their speaking---and, remember, it is
     speech that distinguishes mankind from donkeys, dogs, and vermin---we can
     divide them into three groups: the first kind do not worry about what they
     pass on, they say everything that comes into their heads, without keeping
     to the truth or correcting mistakes, and this is the case with the majority
     of people. Another group speak in order to defend their own fixed opinions,
     or to protest against what they believe to be false, without trying to
     establish the truth, merely holding their ground. This is frequently the
     case, but it is not so serious as the first group. The third group makes
     use of language in the way of Allāh intended and this is more precious than
     red sulphur.

210. Endless anxiety awaits a man who is goaded[^mean-goad] or irritated by
     justice.

211. Two kinds of people live a life without care: one kind are extremely worthy
     of praise, the other kind are extremely worthy of criticism. The two kinds
     are those who care nothing for the pleasures of this world, and those who
     care nothing for _ḥayāʾ_, modesty.

212. To distance ourselves from the vanities of the world, it should suffice to
     remember that every night every man alive, in his sleep, forgets everything
     that worried him during the day, all his fears, all his hopes. He no longer
     remembers his children or his parents, glory or obscurity, high social
     responsibilities or unemployment, poverty or riches, nor catastrophes. Such
     a lesson should be sufficient for a thoughtful person.

213. One of the most marvellous arrangements in Allāh's world is that He has
     made the things that are most necessary also the most easily attainable, as
     can be seen in the case of water and the thing which is even more necessary
     (i.e. air). And the less essential a thing is, the rarer it is, as can be
     seen in the case of sapphires and things which are even less useful.

214. With all the worries, a man is like someone walking across a desert. Every
     time that he crosses a certain area, he sees other areas opening in front
     of him. Likewise, every time that a man gets something done, he finds other
     tasks piling up.

215. That man was right who said that the good have a hard time in this world.
     But the man who said that the good are at rest was also right. The good do
     suffer from all the evil that they see spread over everything, dominating
     it, and all the appearances of injustice which rear up between true justice
     and themselves. But their calmness comes from [their indifference to] all
     the vanities of this world which so worry the rest of mankind.

216. Take care not to agree with a wicked speaker, nor to help your
     contemporaries by doing anything which might harm you in this world or the
     next---however little---for you will reap nothing but regret, at a time
     when regret will not help you at all. The man you helped will not thank
     you. On the contrary, he will rejoice at your misfortune, or at least---you
     may be certain---he will be indifferent to the bad results [of your action]
     and your sad ending. But guard against contradicting the speaker and
     opposing your contemporaries to the extent that you harm yourself in this
     world or the next, however little. You will reap only loss, hostility, and
     enmity. You may even allow yourself to take sides, and you may suffer
     considerable trials which will be of no benefit [to you] whatsoever.

<!-- Arabic Source C
إن لم يكن بد من إغضاب الناس أو إغضاب الله عز وجل، ولم يكن لك مندوحة عن منافرة الحق ومنافرة الخلق، فأغضب الناس ونافرهم، ولا تغضب ربك ولا تنافر الحق.
-->

217. If you have to choose between annoying people or annoying the Almighty, and
     if there is no way out except either to run away from the Truth or to run
     away from the people, you should choose to annoy the people and run away
     from them, but do not annoy your Lord, do not run away from the
     Truth.[^injustice]

[^injustice]: The original trans. reads “...to run away from the right..,” and
“...do not run away from injustice.” I've changed it to reflect the original
Arabic [الحق]{lang=ar} [Source C] and fixed the typographical error in the
latter.

218. You should imitate the Prophet !pbuh when he preached to the ignorant, the
     sinful, and the wicked. Anyone who preaches drily[^mean-drily] and
     cheerlessly is doing wrong and is not applying the Prophet's method. Such
     preaching would usually only drive his audience to persist in their wicked
     ways, from obstinacy, anger, and rage against the insolent sermonizer. He
     would then have done bad with his talk, not good. But a man who exhorts in
     a friendly fashion, with a smile and with gentleness, putting on the
     appearance of offering advice and seeming to be speaking of a third person
     when he criticises the faults of the one he is speaking to, then his words
     reach farther and have more effect. But if they are not well received, he
     should go on to exhort or to appeal to the man's sense of shame, but only
     in private. And if [his advice] is still not taken, he should speak in the
     presence of someone who will make the sinner change. This is the practice
     which Allāh ordains when He commands the use of “courteous terms.” The
     Prophet !pbuh used not to address his listeners directly; instead, he would
     say to them, “What are they thinking of, the people who do such thing?…” He
     !pbuh praised gentleness, commended us to be tolerant and not to argue. He
     !pbuh varied his sermons so as not to be boring. And Allāh has said, “If
     you are harsh, and hard-hearted, they would have scattered from about you.”
     (Quran 3:159) Severity and hardness should not be used except to inflict
     the punishment ordained by Allāh. A man who has been given special
     authority to inflict such punishment must not be gentle.

219. Something which can also have a good effect in a sermon is to praise, in
     the presence of a wrongdoer, somebody who has acted differently. This is an
     incitement to behave better. I know no other benefit of the love of praise:
     a person who hears another being praised models himself on him. It is for
     this reason that we should tell stories of virtue and vice, so that anyone
     who hears them may turn away from the wicked deed that he hears others have
     done and accomplish the good deeds that he hears that others have done,
     thus learning from history.

220. I have considered everything that lives beneath the skies, I have reflected
     long upon it, and I have observed that everything that exists, whether
     animate or inanimate, has a natural tendency to build itself up by
     divesting the other species of their characteristics and investing them
     with his own. Thus, a virtuous man hopes that all mankind will become
     virtuous and the sinner hopes that all mankind will become sinful. One may
     observe that everybody who recalls a past action of their own which they
     incite others to imitate says, “I always do such and such.” Someone with a
     doctrine wishes that everybody would agree with him. This phenomenon can
     also be seen among the elements: when some become stronger than others,
     they change them to their own substance: you can see how trees are formed,
     and how plants and trees are nourished by transforming water and the
     moisture in the soil to their own substance. For this may glory be given to
     Him who created and organized all things, there is no other Lord but He.

221. One of the most astonishing manifestations of Allāh's power is that
     [despite] the great number of creatures that exist, you never see one so
     alike another that there is no difference between them. I asked a man who
     was very old and had reached his eighties whether he had ever seen in the
     past any form that resembled somebody nowadays to the point of being
     identical. “No,” he replied, “on the contrary, every form has something
     distinctive about it.” The same is true of everything that exists in the
     world. Whoever makes a study of various objects and of the bodies they make
     up, whoever makes a long and frequent examination of them, knows this, and
     is able to discern the differences and to distinguish one object from
     another thanks to the nuances which the soul can perceive but words cannot
     express. Glory then to the Almighty, the Omniscient, whose power is
     infinite.

222. A curious thing in this world is to see people allow themselves to be
     dominated by perverse hopes which will bring them nothing but trouble in
     the short term and anxiety and sin in the long term. For example, one
     person will hope for a rise in the price of foodstuffs, a rise which might
     be fatal for some people. But, even if one has a certain interest in
     something happening, the fact that one hopes for it does not make it happen
     before its time, and nothing will happen that Allāh has not decided. If he
     had wished for the good and the prosperity of other people, he would have
     speeded his own reward, and achieved peace of mind and virtue, without
     fatiguing himself at all. Be amazed at the useless corruption of these
     characters!
