All praise belongs to Allāh, Lord of all the worlds. May peace and
blessings be upon our Prophet Muḥammad, upon his family, his companions
and all those who follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment.

This [pdf]{.smallcaps} file is a translation of Ibn Ḥazm's !m[him] book _Kitāb al-Akhlāq wa al-Siyar fī Mudāwat al-Nufūs_.
Its content is from [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/AlIkhlaqWalSiyarMoralsAndBehaviourIbnHazmforBothTeachersAndTheTaught).
The translation was originally a part of the book _In Pursuit of Virtue_ by Shaykh Muḥammad Abū Laylā.
_In Pursuit of Virtue_ covers many aspects of Ibn Ḥazm's life along with discussions of his moral theology.
This document is just the last part of the book and was not produced for any monetary benefit.
It was produced for making the works of Ibn Ḥazm accessible to a larger audience.

I have edited the source that was used for this document.
Most of the edits are in punctuation and design.
However, I've also replaced the term “God” with “Allāh” where applicable.
!PDForEPUB(For the word definitions in the footnotes, I have used the Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Ed.)
If you find any mistakes, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Dear reader, I hope you enjoy this document as much as I enjoyed creating it, if not more.
May Allāh accept our efforts and rectify our souls.
