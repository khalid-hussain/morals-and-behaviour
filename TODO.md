## Point 141

**Original Arabic**

لَا تكلّف صديقك إِلَّا مثل مَا تبذل لَهُ من نَفسك فَإِن طلبت أَكثر فَأَنت ظَالِم
وَلَا تكسب إِلَّا على شَرط الْفَقْد وَلَا تتول إِلَّا على شَرط الْعَزْل وَإِلَّا
فَأَنت مُضر بِنَفْسِك خَبِيث السِّيرَة.

**Original translation**

Do not ask of your friend more than you yourself are prepared to give.
To ask for more is to abuse his friendship.
Do not gain except when you will harm yourself and your behaviour will be detestable.

**HP's translation**

Burden your friend only as much as you can offer/sacrifice for him from yourself,
for if you demand more than that you are an oppressor.
And do not earn/gain (anything from him) except on a condition of loss (for yourself).
And do not turn away (from him) except on a condition of solitude (for yourself), if you don't do this then you will be harmful for yourself.

**BF's translation**

Do not ask your friend to do something for you unless you are ready to do the same thing for him.
If you ask him more than that which you do for him, then it is a form of injustice.
Similarly, do not own unless you know you may lose;
and do not lead unless you know you may leave.
Otherwise, you are detrimental to your own yourself and ill-mannered.

**S's translation**

Do not ask (expect) of your friend more than you are prepared to give yourself.
As asking for more will be injustice on your part.
Do not make your friend except with a condition you may lose him (i.e his friendship) or may isolate you.
If you do not consider it, you will harm yourself and develop detestable behaviour.

**Abu Joseph's translation**

Treat your friend with fairness, cost him as much as you spend on him with
Pure soul, so if you asked for more, you are unjust, and don't earn unless
with the condition of loss, and don't accept the public position unless you
make a condition for Dismissal, otherwise, you bring damage to yourself, and
provide a Bad reputation.

**Zahraa's translation**

Do not burden your friend except with as much as you would be willing to sacrifice for him.
For if you demand more than that, you would be an oppressor.
Do not gain except on the condition of loss, and do not take up a position except on the condition that you will leave it.
Otherwise, you will harm yourself and taint your own reputation.
