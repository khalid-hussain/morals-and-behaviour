# TODO

## NOT YET

- 6, 8, 9, 12 (poem)
- Various spellings of Judgement/Judgement
- Change CSS for numbers of ordered list to be center and above the current paragraph.
- Add conditional macros for Arabic honorifics for EPUB/LATEX.
- Separate footnotes into a separate file. Separate definition footnotes into
  a separate file so that they can be excluded in the EPUB. This is because
  EPUB readers usually come built-in with a dictionary.
- Check the positions of --- dashes. Make sure they are attached to the word
  that follows.
- Find out how to reference the Quran brackets. Should they be inside the
  sentence or outside? If outside, then how do we start a new sentence?
