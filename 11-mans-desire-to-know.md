# Man's Desire to Know

325. There are longings from which hardly anyone is exempt, except a man whose
     thoughts are completely vile or one who has trained himself by a perfect
     system of discipline and has completely tamed the power of his angry soul.
     In order to cure the avid desire that the soul feels to seize information
     that one wants to conceal from it or to see an object that one wants to
     hide from it, you should think of all the things of the same kind which
     escape it in places where it has not been, let alone the most distant areas
     of the earth. If the person worries about them he is completely mad and
     totally lacking in reason. [On the other hand] if he is not worried about
     these other things, is the thing hidden from him not the same as these
     things that do not worry him, absolutely identical in fact? He should
     multiply the arguments directed against his passion, and he should speak to
     his soul with the voice of reason,“O my soul, if you did not know that
     there was something there being hidden from you, do you think that you
     would worry about getting to know it?” There is no doubt that the answer
     would be “No.” Then he should say to his soul,“Act as if you did not know
     that there was something there being hidden from you. Then you can relax
     and you will be able to drive away your anxiety and calm your painful
     agitation and your hateful greed.” These are numerous victories,
     considerable gains, and noble ambitions to which a wise man aspires and
     which only someone totally lacking disdains.

326. As for the man who has the ambition and the obsession to spread his fame to
     every country and to be remembered throughout the centuries, let him
     reflect and say to his soul, “O my soul, if you were gloriously famous in
     all the countries of the world for all eternity and to the end of time, but
     if I was not told about it and if I knew nothing about it, do you think I
     would be happy or satisfied about it, yes or no?” There is no doubt that
     the answer would be “No,” for any other answer would be impossible. Having
     convinced himself of this truth, the man must understand that when he is
     dead he will have no possibility of knowing whether he is famous or not.
     Moreover he would not know while he was still alive if nobody told him.

327. He should also consider two important points. First, that there have been
     in earlier times a great number of virtuous Prophets and Messengers of
     Allāh !s[them] of whom nobody on the surface of the earth remembers their
     name, nor their history, nor their trace, nor any memory, nor the slightest
     thing about them.

328. Second, there have been, among the good and virtuous men who were the
     companions of the Prophets in ancient times, ascetics, philosophers,
     scholars, excellent men, kings of nations which have disappeared, founders
     of cities which are now deserted, and courtesans of princes whose history
     has also not reached us. Nobody knows anything about them nowadays and
     nobody has the slightest knowledge that they existed. Has this fact harmed
     any of them? Has it diminished their merit and destroyed their good deeds?
     Has it lowered them in the eyes of their Almighty Creator? Let me tell
     anyone who did not already know it, that there does not exist anywhere in
     the world the smallest scrap of information about any of the earthly
     sovereigns or the ancient generations who preceded men's historical
     knowledge, which begins with the kings of Isrāʾīl. And everything that we
     know of the history of the sovereigns of Greece and of Persia does not go
     back further than two thousand years. Where is the remembrance of the men
     who peopled the earth before them? Is it not, in fact, totally wiped out,
     vanished, forgotten?

    This is why the Almighty has spoken of “Messengers of whom We have not
    told you the history at all,” (Quran 4:164) and Allāh also said, “Many
    centuries in between,” (Quran 25:38) and Allāh also said, “Those who came
    after and who are known only to Allāh” [Quran 14:9]. Even if the memory of
    a man persists for a short period of time, would that in itself make him
    any different from those who lived in olden times in nations that have
    disappeared and of which the memory also persisted a short while before
    being completely lost?

329. We should also think of those who were famous for their good deeds or their
     bad deeds; did their fame raise them one single degree in the sight of
     Allāh? Did it win them a reward that they had not already won by their
     actions during their life?

330. Since this is so, the desire to be famous is nothing but the desire for
     something absolutely senseless and useless. On the contrary, a wise man
     should aspire only to multiply his virtues and good deeds, which make the
     one who applies himself to them merit a good reputation, praise,
     commendation, and a praiseworthy reputation which will bring him nearer to
     his Creator and will be useful in remembering him to the Almighty. He will
     keep himself in this beneficial state and will never be lost for all
     eternity; assistance is from Allāh.

331. Gratitude towards a benefactor is a necessary obligation. To fulfill it,
     you should at least render to him the good that he had done to you and
     more. Afterwards, you should show interest in his affairs, protect him as
     much as possible, faithfully keep to promises you have made him, in his
     life or after his death, and to his relations, both distant and close. Thus
     you should continue to show affection to him, to give him advice. You
     should make his good qualities known truthfully and you should conceal his
     faults. [These obligations lie upon you] for the rest of your life and
     should be handed down to your descendents and to those you love.

332. However, it is no part of gratitude to assist someone in committing sin and
     not advise him in cases where he is doing himself harm in this world and
     the next. On the contrary, anyone who helps his benefactor to do evil is
     deceiving him, denying his benefactions, acting unjustly in his respect,
     and failing to recognize his goodness. Moreover, the bounties and
     benefactions of Allāh towards each one of His creatures are much more
     considerable, more longstanding, and more salutary than those of any other
     benefactor. Indeed, it is the Almighty who has opened our eyes to see, who
     has pierced our ears to hear, it is He who has granted us the other
     excellent senses and has endowed us with speech and discernment, two
     benefits by grace of which we have been made able to hear His words. He has
     subjected to our service everything which exists in the skies and upon the
     earth---stars and elements---and has placed none of His creatures above us,
     except only His holy angels, the inhabitants of the heavens. What are the
     gifts of men compared with these! Anyone who imagines that he is thanking a
     benefactor by helping him to do evil, or by taking his side when he should
     not, would be denying the gifts of the greatest of his benefactors, whose
     gifts he would be failing to recognize. He would not be rendering thanks to
     Him to whom all thanks truly belong, he would not be praising Him who is
     the essence of praiseworthiness, that is to say, Allāh Almighty.

    Anyone who steps between his benefactor and evil, leading him back to the
    bitter truth, would be showing true gratitude and would be fulfilling
    perfectly his obligation towards him. Praises be to Allāh at first and at
    last and in all circumstances!
