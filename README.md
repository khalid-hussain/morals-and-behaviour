# بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ

All praise belongs to Allāh, Lord of all the worlds. May peace and blessings
be upon our Prophet Muḥammad, upon his family, his companions and all those
who follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment.

# About

This repository is about creating a crisp PDF/HTML copy of Imam Ibn Ḥazm's
book, "Kitāb al-Akhlāq wa Siyar."

## Note

Knowledge of text files, `make` files, and XeLaTeX is required to compile the
project. I will not entertain any queries regarding this; there are a lot of
places to learn online. Do not open issues regarding compilation if you don't
know what you're doing.

# How to compile

1. Run `make epub` or `make latex`.
2. (Add further method for XeLaTeX. EPUB needs no other step.)

# Questions

1. But the book is already available on the website mentioned under 'Sources'?

  **Ans:** Yes. But it's not to the standards I hold myself to.
